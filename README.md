## Preparation
This code is developed under the [multispectral fusion detection framework](https://github.com/ljcuestc/YoloMultispectralFusion-Coarse-to-fine-Registration). 
For the operation of this code, you need to copy the dec_fusion_multispectral_wcndt.py and the detect_multispectral_wcndt.py and replace the correspinding [dec_fusion_multispectral_final.py](https://github.com/ljcuestc/YoloMultispectralFusion-Coarse-to-fine-Registration/blob/main/dec_fusion_multispectral_final.py) and the [detect_multispectral.py](https://github.com/ljcuestc/YoloMultispectralFusion-Coarse-to-fine-Registration/blob/main/detect_multispectral.py) under the [github repository](https://github.com/ljcuestc/YoloMultispectralFusion-Coarse-to-fine-Registration).
